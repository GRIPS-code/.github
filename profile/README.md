# Gas-Radiation Interactions: Parameterizations and Standards 

This collection of repositories is the home of the GRIPS project. We seek to increase access to radiative transfer 
and spectroscopic tools to enable users to build fast models of integrated absorption by gases for use in models 
of the atmosphere. 


GRIPS is a collaboration among the
[Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University](https://crew.ldeo.columbia.edu), 
[NOAA's Geosphysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory](https://gfdl.noaa.gov), 
[Atmospheric and Environmental Research](https://rtweb.aer.com), 
the [Meteorological Institute at the University of Hamburg](https://www.mi.uni-hamburg.de/en.html), 
and the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://staff.ucar.edu/users/brianpm).
